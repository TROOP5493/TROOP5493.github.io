<h1>Explaining a Simple JavaScript Program</h1>

<p>
This web page explains a <strong>short JavaScript program</strong> that determines whether a number is even or odd.
The program is <em>simple</em>, but it demonstrates an important programming idea: using logic to produce output
based on input.
</p>

<h2>The Program Code</h2>

<p>
Below is a code fragment from the program. The variable <code>number</code> stores user input, and the program
produces output using a conditional statement.
</p>

<pre>
<code>
let number = 7;

if (number % 2 === 0) {
    console.log("The number is even.");
} else {
    console.log("The number is odd.");
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>
In this program, the <code>number</code> variable represents the <abbr title="Information entered into a program">input</abbr>.
The output is a message displayed in the console stating whether the number is even or odd.
</p>

<p>
For example, if the input is <mark>7</mark>, the output will be <q>The number is odd.</q>
</p>

<p>
This decision-making process is an example of <dfn>conditional logic</dfn>, which allows a program to choose
between different actions.
</p>

<p>
According to one programming book:
</p>

<blockquote>
“Programs are written to solve problems by breaking them into precise, logical steps.”
</blockquote>

<p>
This quote comes from <cite>Starting Out with Programming Logic and Design</cite>, which emphasizes how logic
controls program behavior.
</p>

<p>
An important acronym related to this concept is <abbr title="If This Then That">IFTTT</abbr>.
It describes how programs make decisions based on conditions.
</p>

<p>
<small>
Understanding how variables and conditions work is <ins>essential</ins> for learning JavaScript,
and ignoring them would be a <del>mistake</del>.
</small>
</p>

<p>
Overall, this program shows how a small amount of code can produce meaningful results,
and it serves as a <sub>basic</sub> introduction to programming logic.
