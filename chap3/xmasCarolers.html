<h2>How to Ward Them Off:</h2>

<p>
<span class="italic">Turn out the lights</span><br>
A dark house may deter them from stopping, since they think no one is home. 
Turning out the lights belatedly after they have arrived at your door will send 
a strong message, but carolers are frequently very determined.
</p>

<p>
<span class="italic">Turn up your music</span><br>
Play heavy metal rock, which is likely to be in a different key than the carolers, 
who will be unable to stay in tune, become discouraged and depart. If you are 
listening to Christmas music, shut it off immediately, or they may be encouraged to sing along.
</p>

<p>
<span class="italic">Answer the door in a robe or towel</span><br>
Embarrassed, the carolers may simply leave. Such clothing choices may offend 
them and make them unable to sing. Call to another person inside the house 
(real or imaginary), “I’ll be right back.”
</p>

<p>
<span class="italic">Answer the door holding a telephone</span><br>
Shout into phone, “I can’t hear you! There are carolers singing!” until the carolers move on.
