<h1>Lawrence Hydropower</h1>

<h2>History of Lawrence Hydropower</h2>

<p>
In 1874, residents of Lawrence, Kansas had burned most of the region’s
available wood, and fossil fuels were not yet accessible. To address
this problem, Orlando Darling built a dam across the Kansas River north
of town. He used a water wheel connected by mechanical cables to power
local industries.
</p>

<p>
Later, Justin Bowersock purchased the operation and named it
<dfn>The Bowersock Mills &amp; Power Company</dfn>. The company became
known simply as Bowersock.
</p>

<p>
Bowersock’s slogan is:
</p>

<p>

Producing clean, renewable hydropower since 1874
</a>
</p>

<h2>Industrial Growth and Power Expansion</h2>

<p>
By 1885, twelve water wheels powered two flouring mills, a paper mill,
two elevators, a twine factory, a shirt factory, two machine shops, the
Leis chemical works, two printing offices, the barbed wire works, and
several smaller industries.
</p>

<p>
After rebuilding from ice damage in 1888, Bowersock introduced four
dynamos that converted mechanical energy into electrical energy.
</p>

<p>
To supplement the original 2.4-megawatt power plant on the south side of
the river, Bowersock later added a new 4.6-megawatt plant on the north
side.
</p>

<h2>Power Contracts and Energy Management</h2>

<p>
To raise funds for the new 4.6-megawatt plant, Bowersock signed a
25-year power-purchase agreement with Kansas City’s Board of Public
Utilities (BPU). Under this agreement, <strong>Bowersock must send BPU
at least 80% of its total generating capacity on an annual average
basis</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Instantaneous power output is proportional to the water flow rate and
the height difference of the water. Because river flow varies with
rainfall, the amount of power generated also varies.
</p>

<p>
To maximize deliverable energy, Bowersock uses a run-of-the-river policy.
This approach keeps the upstream water level as high as possible and
uses whatever flow is available.
</p>

<p>
Although energy can be stored by raising the upstream water height,
doing so could interfere with Bowersock’s contract obligations. As a
result, until the BPU contract ends, the energy stored behind the dam
is not available for use by the city of Lawrence.
