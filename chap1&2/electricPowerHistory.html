<h1>Electric Power History</h1>

<h2>Brief History of Electric Power</h2>

<p>
Thomas Edison’s first electric power plant generated 110-volt direct current (DC)
for lighting and variable-speed machinery in nearby buildings. However, transmitting
power over long distances required higher voltages. At the time, the only way to
transform DC voltage was to use a generator set, or “genset,” which consisted of a
DC motor driving a DC generator.
</p>

<p>
Later, Nikola Tesla invented the alternating current (AC) induction motor and the
transformer. AC systems allowed electricity to be transmitted more efficiently over
long distances. Although induction motors could not easily change speed, they were
cheaper and more durable than DC motors. Because transformers had no moving parts,
they were also more reliable than DC systems.
</p>

<p>
As a result, AC power became dominant in the early 20th century, winning what became
known as the “war of the currents.”
</p>

<p>
In the mid-20th century, the rise of computers increased the demand for DC power.
The invention of the insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) and voltage-source
converters (VSCs) allowed DC power to be easily converted and controlled. These
technologies made it possible to run AC motors at variable speeds.
</p>

<p>
Today, DC power, computer control, and the internet help integrate renewable energy
sources such as wind and solar. Electrical systems are evolving into smaller,
self-sufficient networks known as microgrids.
